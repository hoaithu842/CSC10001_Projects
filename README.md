      //HORSESGAME
• Game has 4 maps in total: Line Map, Spiral Map, Zigzag Map and U Map.
• Game can be played by multiple players with multiple horses for each player.

+ At the beginning, player will be asked to provide choices about map to play, board
size, range of dice and information about players in general.
+ At every turn of every player, after seeing dice result, that player will have to pick
which horse to move.

+ Player who gets all horses came to the finish point first is the winner, there is no
”tie” for the game.
+ Horses of the same player can kick each other.
+ Horse won’t kick other horses to start while moving but the one at the destination
point.
